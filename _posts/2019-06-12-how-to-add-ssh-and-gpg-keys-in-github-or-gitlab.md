# Configure git
Initial configuration of git if you have not set yet.
```
git config --global color.ui true
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR@EMAIL.com"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "YOUR@EMAIL.com"
```
# Adding SSH key
Run this command in your terminal to generate new ssh key
```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "YOUR@EMAIL.com"
```
The next step is to take the newly generated SSH key and add it to your Github or GitLab account. You can add SSH key in your setting of GitLab or GitHub. You want to copy and paste the output of the following command and paste it in your ssh key setting.
```shell
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Once you've done this, you can check and see if it worked:

```shell
# For GitHub
ssh -T git@github.com

# OR for GitLab
ssh -T git@gitlab.com
```
You will get a message like this
```
# For GitHub
Hi <your_usename>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

# OR for GitLab
Welcome to GitLab, @<your_username>!
```

# Signing commits with GPG
GitHub or GitLab can show whether a commit is verified or not when signed with a GPG key. All you need to do is upload the public GPG key in your profile settings.

# Generating a GPG key
If you don’t already have a GPG key, the following steps will help you get started:
1. [Install GPG][gpg-install-link] for your operating system. If your Operating System has `gpg2` installed, replace `gpg` with `gpg2` in the following commands.
2. Generate the private/public key pair with the following command, which will spawn a series of questions:
```shell
gpg --full-gen-key
```
3. The first question is which algorithm can be used. Select the kind you want or press `Enter` to choose the default (RSA and RSA):
Please select what kind of key you want:
```shell
(1) RSA and RSA (default)
(2) DSA and Elgamal
(3) DSA (sign only)
(4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1
```
4. The next question is key length. We recommend to choose the highest value which is 4096:
```shell
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
```
5. Next, you need to specify the validity period of your key. This is something subjective, and you can use the default value which is to never expire:
```shell
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
        0 = key does not expire
     <n>  = key expires in n days
     <n>w = key expires in n weeks
     <n>m = key expires in n months
     <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
```
6. Confirm that the answers you gave were correct by typing `y`:
```shell
Is this correct? (y/N) y
```
7. Enter you real name, the email address to be associated with this key (should match a verified email address you use in GitLab) and an optional comment (press Enter to skip):
```shell
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.
Real name: Mr. Robot
Email address: <your_email>
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
   "Mr. Robot <your_email>"
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
```
8. Pick a strong password when asked and type it twice to confirm.
9. Use the following command to list the private GPG key you just created:
```shell
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG <your_email>
```
<i>Replace ```<your_email>``` with the email address you entered above.</i>
10. Copy the GPG key ID that starts with sec. In the following example, that’s 30F2B65B9246B6CA:
```shell
sec   rsa4096/30F2B65B9246B6CA 2017-08-18 [SC]
     D5E4F29F3275DC0CDA8FFC8730F2B65B9246B6CA
uid                   [ultimate] Mr. Robot <your_email>
ssb   rsa4096/B7ABC0813E4028C0 2017-08-18 [E]
```
11. Export the public key of that ID (replace your key ID from the previous step):
```shell
gpg --armor --export 30F2B65B9246B6CA
```
12. Finally, copy the public key and add it in your profile settings

# Associating your GPG key with Git
After you have created your GPG key and added it to your account, it’s time to tell Git which key to use.

1. Use the following command to list the private GPG key you just created:
```shell
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG <your_email>
```
Replace ```<your_email>``` with the email address you entered above.
2. Copy the GPG key ID that starts with sec. In the following example, that’s 30F2B65B9246B6CA:
```shell
sec   rsa4096/30F2B65B9246B6CA 2017-08-18 [SC]
     D5E4F29F3275DC0CDA8FFC8730F2B65B9246B6CA
uid                   [ultimate] Mr. Robot <your_email>
ssb   rsa4096/B7ABC0813E4028C0 2017-08-18 [E]
```
3. Tell Git to use that key to sign the commits:
```shell
git config --global user.signingkey 30F2B65B9246B6CA
```
Replace 30F2B65B9246B6CA with your GPG key ID.

# Signing commits
After you have created your GPG key and added it to your account, you can start signing your commits:
1. Commit like you used to, the only difference is the addition of the -S flag:
```shell
git commit -S -m "My commit msg"
```
2. Enter the passphrase of your GPG key when asked.
3. Push to GitLab and check that your commits are verified.

If you don’t want to type the -S flag every time you commit, you can tell Git to sign your commits automatically:
```shell
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

# Verifying commits
Within a project or merge request, navigate to the Commits tab. Signed commits will show a badge containing either “Verified” or “Unverified”, depending on the verification status of the GPG signature.
